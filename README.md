#### The SquareSpace Template of the World's Best Web Comic

First thing's first: go [read the comic](http://battlepug.com/comic/first). It's really good! You'll like it!

Next thing: this isn't your typical SquareSpace template. SquareSpace doesn't officially support web comics yet, so I had to do a few kludgey things to make it work. Sadly, said kludgey things were done three years ago and don't really remember all their ins and outs. I'm digging back into it now, and will update this documentation with more helpful instructions once I wrap my head around it again.

In the mean time, intrepid folk with SquareSpace developer accounts can clone this repository and push it to their sites. You should get a functioning clone of [battlepug.com](http://battlepug.com), *sans* all the content, of course.

If you have pressing questions about how to do a thing, create an issue here, and I'll try to get to that first.

Thanks for interest, your patience, and your love of the pug.
